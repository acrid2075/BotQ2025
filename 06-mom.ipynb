Specifically, you reproduce and extend (the original sample was about 1963 to 1990) **the momentum effect** of Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) (see \"Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers: Implications for Stock Market Efficiency\"). This empirical result spawned a huge literature in academic finance, and has been a critical core strategy for quant hedge funds (and others) for the last 30 years. You will find out in the next couple of weeks that models like the CAPM can't explain this portfolio return pattern at all. \n",
